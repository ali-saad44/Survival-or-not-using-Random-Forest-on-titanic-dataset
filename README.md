# 🚢 Survival or Not using Random Forest on Titanic Dataset

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the **Kaggle Titanic dataset** and a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset comes from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
